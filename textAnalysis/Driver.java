Do you think it was a great film? If so, why?  2) The evolving relationship between Chief Gillespie (Rod Steiger)and Detective Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier) is one of the most compelling aspects of the film. Discuss their relationship.  3) The quote They call me Mister Tibbs! was listed as number 16 on the American Film Institute's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes, a list of top film quotes. Why do you think it is so famous?   4) Why do you think the scene where detective Tibbs slaps Eric Endicott caused so much controversy? Read the article below to find out the true story behind “one of the most revolutionary acts committed to film.” b) Also, read about why Poitier was reluctant to shoot the film in the South and discuss your             reaction to his experience as a black actor in the Sixties.   http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/story-of-the-scene-in-the-heat-of-the-night-1967-1676905.html  5) How is Sidney Poitier’s character a radical departure from traditional depictions of African-American in film? Reference films we watched earlier such as D.W. Griffith The Birth of Nation and Gone With the Wind.  6) Many of you have recently watched Lee Daniel’s The Butler. Which film is more effective as a teaching tool in terms of understanding the civil rights era?  7) In the Heat of the Night came out the same year as Guess Who Is Coming to Dinner, which dealt with the controversial topic of interracial marriage. Interracial marriage was illegal in 17 states until June of 1967, six months before the film was released, when anti-miscegenation laws were invalidated by the Supreme Court in Loving v. Virginia. We watched a powerful scene in which Dr. John Prentice (Sidney Poitier) has a huge fight with his father over his love for the Joanna Drayton. Are there any movies today that deal with contemporary racial tensions? Are there any African-American actors that have the stature, charisma and cultural influence that Poitier had in the Sixties?

Sydney Poitier and Rod Steiger's performance were intense and realistic, really embodying the spirit of racism, evident in both blacks and whites. The movie had a lot of symbolic aspects to it, despite just the slap. The contrast between the different African American characters, such as between Mr. Tibbs, the butler, and the sharecroppers, displayed the tiers within the Black Community, and the different expectations/ opportunities for African Americans in the South and the North. However, I'm a bit confused as to the interaction between Tibbs and the butler, and the significance of it. Certainly, it was an important landmark to serve an African American in a white, plantation-owners house, and so Tibbs took advantage of that. But he did not address the butler with respect, quite, but more with authority, which was odd, considering.  The scenes that took place at the diner were amazingly done, in my opinion. The heat, the stench, the stickiness - it all came across to me, and the server made me feel uncomfortable through the screen. I really felt apart of the time period during those scenes in particular, and enjoyed the realistic vehemence with which the server refused to serve Tibbs.  Sydney Poitier's character really was a radical departure from what we had earlier seen, especially in comparison to A Birth of a Nation which has unveiled racism evident within it. I feel that because he was a playing a man of his time, really affected by discrimination and the Civil Rights and Black Power movements, that Sydney Poitier could embody the strong, African American lead that Mr. Tibbs was.  Reply  hermioneJune 3, 2014 at 4:01 PM I thought In the Heat of the Night was a great movie, not just because of Sidney Poitier's acting, but also because of how well it embodied the spirit of the 60s. Because In the Heat of the Night was filmed in the late 6s, the racist ideology of the people who lived in Southern towns and little details like the law jockey in front of Endicott’s mansion. In addition, the movie did well to portray the “obvious” shows of racism, like when Virgil Tibbs is surrounded by a gang of white boys, threatening him. The movie also showed the “quieter” side of racism and microaggressions, such as when Delore’s brother said he didn’t want Tibbs in the room, Henshaw refusing to serve Tibbs, and Tibbs consistently being called “boy” by the other police officers. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of In the Heat of the Night was the evolution of the relationship between Chief Gillespie and Detective Tibbs, which brought the heart to the movie. From the initially racist treatment that Gillespie witnessed and did nothing to change, to Gillespie walking away from another police officer who informed Gillespie that “the last chief we had would’ve bashed [Tibb’s] head in”. The final scene, where Gillespie tells Tibbs to take care of himself really solidifies the change in Gillespie, and his respect for the intelligence that Tibbs possesses. - Eda Tse  Reply  Julian KalogerakisJune 3, 2014 at 4:44 PM In the Heat of the Night deserved all of its academy awards without a doubt; the film was so powerful in its language and acting that it compelled audiences of its time and still resonates with savvy film critics such as ourselves. In fact, in comparison to Birth of a Nation, The Butler, and Gone With The Wind, I believe it was more interesting and exciting movie. The Butler had its historical inaccuracies, as Eugene Allen never had a son named Louis who was involved with the SCLC, but really the thing that separated it from In the Heat of the Night was that it was meant to document a very specific portion of that history and then expanded as it went along to accommodate for a more generic viewpoint. This contrasted In the Heat of the Night in that it failed to use a self contained plot to truly represent the general zeitgeist of the time. In the Heat of the Night also beat out Birth of a Nation and Gone With The Wind because of its social and moral significance; the message delivered through the slap heard around the world and moments such as They call me Mr. Tibbs! really were appealing both to civil rights activists of the time and the general audience in today's theaters. This is not to say the relevance of the topic has diminished, also, as the film can now be seen more as the ultimate insight into prejudiced roots of the south with some exciting scenes characteristic of any good thriller. - Julian Kalogerakis  Reply  Ioana SolomonJune 3, 2014 at 5:01 PM I felt utterly restless through every moment of In the Heat of the Night. What our age group would presumptuously consider a dated film was actually a masterpiece in every way. In fact, the film being shot in this time period gave us access to societally, environmentally, and behaviorally unique elements. Sydney Poitier's reactions throughout the film, most memorably the slap to Mr. Endicott's face, were certainly the result of a skillful, experienced actor. But the fact that the film was shot during the 1960s, partially in a town so dangerously racist as Mississippi, made his responses appear more genuine, more spontaneous and perhaps even easier to act. The latter isn't to devalue Poitier as an actor, it is simply to say that slapping a white man, even on set, even when practiced a thousand times, was far more convincing due to the growth of racial tensions, frustration on behalf of Black victims, and the development of the Black Power movement. It was, as the makers call it, a slap heard around the world.   The movie was revolutionary. It eliminated the idea of black subservience and introduced a highly relatable and wonderfully convincing theme of equality through Mr. Tibbs' absolute superiority over inexperienced southern police men. It was the epitome of Black Power.   But lastly, the white actors certainly deserve equal credit in the impact of this film. Rod Steiger (Chief Bill Gillespie) had an especially incredible role as both a weak leader and a lonely man whose respect for duty (where duty was defined as always protecting and defending whites) comes into conflict with his true moral compass. It is more difficult to appear weak than it is to appear strong, and for that Rod Steiger deserves tremendous credit.   I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in pure acting quality not enhanced by modern technological effects, suspense, and a genuinely impactful plot.  Reply  Stephanie LinJune 3, 2014 at 5:02 PM I personally thought that In the Heat of the Night definitely deserved all the awards and recognition it received because it was such a revolutionary film during the civil rights era. It was the first time that an African American actor was portrayed as being superior to the whites, instead of being inferior or just plain obedient, as in Gone with the Wind. It was such a drastic comparison with the Mammy figure in Gone with the Wind, because for the first time, Mr. Tibbs demanded the respect he deserved. What was also remarkable was that Gillespie eventually did give him the respect he deserved. It was amazing to see how his respect for Virgil developed from a soft get out of here to an appreciation for what he did. I feel that this movie was more of a detective Hollywood-esque type of film than it was a film about the influence of civil rights, and that The Butler was more focused on civil rights. Cecil Gaines lived through major events of the civil rights era, from Little Rock Nine to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and I feel like his film is more helpful in understanding the civil rights era directly. However, what people have to take into account is the fact that In The Heat of the Night was such a revolutionary film, especially the slap and the fact that Virgil knew better than the white policemen. In its time period, it was such an extraordinary film that we can accurately use it to display the racial and societal tensions that existed during that period, and how something as simple as a leading African American actor would seem normal today, but wasn't back then.  Reply  Jack YeJune 3, 2014 at 5:12 PM I thought In the Heat of the Night was a great film that needs to be watched even today not only because of its deep plot, but also for its complete and real portrayal of the stereotypes of its time. The film has great historical accuracies which are a reason in itself for people to watch.  One of my favorite scenes was towards the beginning, when Sam went into the train station, saw a black guy and just started searching his pockets and upon finding a lot of money, concluded that he was the murderer. It was very funny when it is later revealed that he, Mr. Tibbs, is in fact a police officer, which really shows the irony. This scene reminds me a lot of a recent autobiography I read by Richard Wright named The Ethics of Living Jim Crow which although was from the 1930s, also mentioned how Mr. Wright was questioned by policemen in the night in the South for no apparent reason. This shows how little racial discrimination had changed, and how although blacks were equal they were still separate. Another scene was when Virgil became exasperated, and yells They call me Mr. Tibbs which really showed how much power the Negro had. The scene is very famous because of its radical portray of the Negro character, which at the time, must have been a first for many movie watchers. Similarly, the slap scene also showed how powerful Virgil was, and how willing he was to stand for himself, which again must have paralyzed many watchers who were shocked. The slap really shows the gradual growth of black Americans, since decades ago, Virgil would have been shot for doing such a thing, as said by Mr. Endicott. Another aspect of the film I noticed was the change of Police Chief Bill Gillespie, who at first wanted nothing to do with Virgil, but was forced to work with him due to his team’s weakness. At the beginning, he couldn’t even trust Virgil, and even when he accepts him, plots to take the credit for capturing the criminal. As the movie progresses however, the two get closer as Gillespie even fights for him against the white mob in the shed, and even asks him to leave out of his own safety. Towards the end, when they are drinking together in Gillespie's house, we see just how close the two have become, and at the end, Gillespie sees Virgil leave, and says goodbye to him. I really liked this ending since it really shows how racism can be changed, as the racist policeman eventually grew to accept and even befriend Virgil.  I thought Sidney Poitier did a great job portraying Virgil Tibbs, who was very different from previous black characters. While those in Birth of a Nation were seen as evil and weak, and those in Gone with the Wind were subservient, Mr. Tibbs was anything but that. From the beginning, the Negro character showed confidence, in the way he calmly handled his arrest, and intelligence. I was actually kind of shocked that the film actually focused on the superiority of the black man to the white men since previous films did nothing of the sort. In the Heat of the Night constantly reminded its audience how great a cop the black man was, and how bad a cop the white man was.  Overall, I thought this was a great film to watch since it accurately showed what was going on during the Civil Rights Era, while also trying to persuade viewers of the greatness of the African American. Although the murder was quite tense and hot, it is the racial tensions and racial message underneath that made this movie the heat of the night.   Reply  Tony FungJune 3, 2014 at 5:39 PM “In the Heat of the Night” was an excellent example of the racism prevalent in the 1960s. Nowhere did Mr. Tibbs go was he not an unwelcomed figure, except in the African-American mechanic’s shop. He encountered resistance with the police, despite the fact that he was a cop. Initially, none of the white police officers believed or trusted his skills as a homicide expert because there was no way in their mind that he could’ve been more educated than he. Eventually, this African-American intellectual shows Mr. Gillespie how useful he is, and proves to everyone his usefulness. I respected how Mr. Tibbs’ could maintain his composure when he was being suspected and handled by the police officers. It would only have turned out worse had he resisted, him being an African-American. Mr. Tibbs symbolic and shocking act of resistance was the “slap heard around the world.” It was the first time in theaters that an African-American could do that to a white man, and what made it worse was that Mr. Gillespie did nothing to retaliate. The Mr. Gillespie a week or so prior would’ve shot anyone who did that right then and there, but the new Mr. Gillespie has changed, according to the mayor. It is surprising how quickly his opinion of Mr. Tibbs has changed from treating him with the same disrespect he has towards any African-American to the utmost respect as he tells Mr. Tibbs to take care as he boards the train. Also, it was unheard of for a white man to drink wine with an African-American man, but they both greatly enjoyed that. Mr. Gillespie even trusts his insecurities with Mr. Tibbs, stating how he was probably the only soul to step foot in that house, that he doesn’t have a wife, and that he is stuck as a sheriff in a town that doesn’t even want him. No character expected this, and surely no person in the 1960s would’ve expected this either.  Reply  Sabrina BariJune 3, 2014 at 5:52 PM This comment has been removed by the author.

Although many people wouldn’t be interested in such a “dated” film, I believe that this characteristic was what truly captured our attention. Although the “Butler” is a modern film, it didn’t portray the racial tensions between the whites and the blacks during that times. In addition, “Gone With the Wind” and “Birth of a Nation” completely subordinated and degenerated");
