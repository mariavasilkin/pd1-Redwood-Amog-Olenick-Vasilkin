Date: Name. what you did. 


06/02/14: Maria. tried out processing for the first time. It's weird. The simple stuff is very very easy though, so that's a good sign!


06/02/14: Jake. made a class which takes input from a large body of text and performs some basic analysis on it.

06/02/14: Anjelika. modified URLReader.

06/03/14: Jake. made progress on getting data about how often words are used (frequency of a word will be compared to average frequency of that word)

06/03/14: Maria. Figuring out processing, but mostly just browsing around stack overflow so far. Nothing to commit today.

06/03/14: Anjelika. URLReader works for oracle homepage but throwing IOException otherwise.

06/04/14: Jake. only in-class work, finished the work from the day before. There is now a usable database of words.


06/04/14: Maria. Worked together with Jake in class on the word frequency stuff. 
06/04/14: Anjelika. Trying to fix security issues with reading URLs.

06/05/14: Jake. Experienced great triumph, followed by great sorrow. Made a pretty-much-fully-operational StringProcessor class. However, also discovered that Java doesn't have triple-quotes like Python, so we'll have to work on string input.

06/05/14: Maria. Added some issues. Processing stuff added (technically added on 06/06/14)

06/06/14: Jake. Began to work on determining if words come from the same root word or not.

06/06/14 - 06/08/14: Worked on getting the processing stuff to work with the java stuff. Failed miserably.

06/09/14: Jake. Did so many things omg. Mainly, used a quickSelect algorithm to get the keywords (referred to as "mainWords", idk why I did that) and also created a means of determining irregular noun plurals.

06/09/14: Maria. Got quite a bit done for processing. Currently have a bloom file that mades a circle burst out, which would presumably be used to show the child nodes popping up after you select a new node. Also a SlideUp file in which the node moves to the place of the parent. So far this one only works for child1. I don't know how to incorporate these together though. 

06/14/14: Anjelika. URLReader works fine and now the contents of a URL read out to a file.
