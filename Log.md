Date: Name. what you did. 


06/02/14: Maria. tried out processing for the first time. It's weird. The simple stuff is very very easy though, so that's a good sign!


06/02/14: Jake. made a class which takes input from a large body of text and performs some basic analysis on it.

06/02/14: Anjelika. modified URLReader.

06/03/14: Jake. made progress on getting data about how often words are used (frequency of a word will be compared to average frequency of that word)

06/03/14: Maria. Figuring out processing, but mostly just browsing around stack overflow so far. Nothing to commit today.

06/03/14: Anjelika. URLReader works for oracle homepage but throwing IOException otherwise.

06/04/14: Jake. only in-class work, finished the work from the day before. There is now a usable database of words.


06/04/14: Maria. Worked together with Jake in class on the word frequency stuff. 
06/04/14: Anjelika. Trying to fix security issues with reading URLs.

06/05/14: Jake. Experienced great triumph, followed by great sorrow. Made a pretty-much-fully-operational StringProcessor class. However, also discovered that Java doesn't have triple-quotes like Python, so we'll have to work on string input.

06/05/14: Maria. Added some issues. Processing stuff added (technically added on 06/06/14)

06/06/14: Jake. Began to work on determining if words come from the same root word or not.

06/06/14 - 06/08/14: Maria. Worked on getting the processing stuff to work with the java stuff. Failed miserably.

06/09/14: Jake. Did so many things omg. Mainly, used a quickSelect algorithm to get the keywords (referred to as "mainWords", idk why I did that) and also created a means of determining irregular noun plurals.

06/09/14: Maria. Got quite a bit done for processing. Currently have a bloom file that mades a circle burst out, which would presumably be used to show the child nodes popping up after you select a new node. Also a SlideUp file in which the node moves to the place of the parent. So far this one only works for child1. I don't know how to incorporate these together though. 

06/11/14: Anjelika. Turns out the problem was the proxy, not our code.

06/13/14-06/15/14(weekend): Maria. Tried to combine the stuff in the different sketches into one file, but it didn't completely work.
Worked on removing HTML tags.

06/14/14: Anjelika. URLReader works fine and now the text of a URL is written out to a text file using TextConverter.

06/16/14: Maria. Made a processing sketch with all of the java done so far, but it's not letting me run it for some reason???? I'm 86% sure that there aren't any erros though. Processing clearly didn;t completely work, so I tried to make a command line input version of the driver that lets you input your search, but that also didn't completely work yet. 

06/17/14:Maria. Got a lot more processing things working! Still can't get everything consolidated under one sketch though. I'm having trouble with any situation where the Draw() method would have to do more than one thing/when it needs to delete previous work/when it needs to delete the data that made previous work. I've been trying noLoop() and redraw(), and that seems to have helped in a few places.

06/18/14: Anjelika. Maria and I met up at Whole Foods to try to put everything under one sketch and found that we had different conceptualizations of the project and so had to solve that problem. Successfully laid groundwork for processing sketch.

06/19/14: Anjelika. Continued to work on project despite lateness. We just wanted to try to see if this could still actually work, now that we were on the same page. Made the processing sketch able to visibly display a seed node and its five children.

06/20/14: Anjelika. Refuses to give up even if this won't be graded. The sketch integrates TextConverter but only works for seed node.
