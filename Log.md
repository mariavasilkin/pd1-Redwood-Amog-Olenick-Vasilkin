Date: Name. what you did.
06/02/14: Maria. tried out processing for the first time. It's weird. The simple stuff is very very easy though, so that's a good sign!
06/02/14: Jake. made a class which takes input from a large body of text and performs some basic analysis on it.
06/03/14: Jake. made progress on getting data about how often words are used (frequency of a word will be compared to average frequency of that word)
06/04/14: Jake. only in-class work, finished the work from the day before. There is now a usable database of words.
06/05/14: Jake. Experienced great triumph, followed by great sorrow. Made a pretty-much-fully-operational StringProcessor class. However, also discovered that Java doesn't have triple-quotes like Python, so we'll have to work on string input.
